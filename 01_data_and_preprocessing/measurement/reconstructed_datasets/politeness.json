You have been accused of sockpuppetry at <url>.  Scared?","1":"user: If you're going to accuse me of operating in bad faith, then the discussion has become inappropriately personal.  On what grounds do you make such an implication?","2":"user: Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you?","3":"user: May I ask why you removed <url> from the article on <url>?  Since CAP is the USAF's official auxiliary, wouldn't it make sense for the CAP article to be in the USAF category?","4":"user: Makes me wanna ask, what do you say about having separate articles like Wikipedia has <url> and <url> or <url> and <url>? Should this be tolerated for non-Transformers stuff?","5":"user: I have some made some improvements to the articles you references on the above user's talk page. Perhaps next time you would bring your concerns directly to '''me'''?","6":"user: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?","7":"user: Dana, before I give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing, I need to know if <url> is still gonna work on the problems. Do you get me?","8":"user: I have no need to search the interwebs, all that matters is it offends people and is a violation of NPOV and MoS. \"All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), representing fairly and without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources)\" - ess-eff is a bias term for a minority group of fans, put it this way: is there an SF-channel, or how often is the clichxe9 ess-eff used outside fan-groups?","9":"user: (after multipled edit conflicts)I checked your behaviour and your contributions myself at the time, as did numerous other admins who reviewed your edits and the block and it was subject of extensive discussion on and off-site so your suggestion that I should have checked with others is silly. You violated Wikipedia's policies and were blocked rightly for it; you've been given a second chance and instead of being productive you come here to moan about a comment I made more than six months ago, that I still stand by, and to pursue your now year-old vendetta against Nick?","10":"user: you have been following me around all week reverting my edits.  what did i do to you?","11":"user: I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn't <url> have specific requirements for this?","12":"user: I kind of agree.  Are you planning on actually editing Wikipedia, or is your whole purpose here to promote this ... study (or whatever it is)?","13":"user: Hey, if you want to assert that a cite does not say what it clearly does say, how about actually coming to the discussion page to discuss it, rather than treating edit summaries like a discussion space?  Why the hell am I the one being accused of edit warring, when I'm the only one actually willing to talk on the discussion page?","14":"user: What is unreliable about the newspaper article reports about the protests in Meliti, Lofi, etc? Are you alleging that the protests against the Greek military did not occur?","15":"user: So do I, because, inspite of my 100s of friends and supporters, I'm feeling a little beleaguered and lonely here. If I can hang on in here, can't you at least keep me company?","16":"user: The only way I have a naval website is that I am one of the people actively working to make sure Wikipedia has good coverage of naval topics here. Which website do you think I run?","17":"user: I see that you closed that CfD discussion as rename, but haven't actually renamed the categories. What's up with that?","18":"user: How about Guant who plays Pansy? Or Richard Fish who played Bill Weasley, and the actor who played Charlie Weasley in POA?","19":"user: And DAB uses a very foul language, persistently, is that right? Did I not talk to you about that already?","20":"user: I'm sorry but looking back on that edit I won't stand for that. Don't you think that actually removing the edit summary was a bit... well... let's say 'abusing sysop powers'?","21":"user: I was not trying to sound rude earlier. Haunted Angel which of my seven reasons had you decided were evidence of his sock puppetry?","22":"user: One question - how come the page is marked as \"in dispute\"?  The data that is currently posted isn't in dispute, correct?","23":"user: Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects?","24":"user: Further: it seems to me that <url> was a perfectly reasonable dab page. I wonder why you needed to change it?","25":"user: Email from the Darkshado guy complaining about you adding him to the spamlist. I searched the site and couldn't find any of our articles replicated there; has he removed them, or what?","26":"user: I'm sure. How about we let the sockpuppet investigation let us know for certain, m'kay?","27":"user: COI? What COI do you think I have?","28":"user: and so is the new Portishead. Did I mention the Knife?","29":"user: I've noticed that you're engaged in several edit wars, with Meliniki, regarding minor alterations to multiple Greek language articles. Perhaps you should consider discussing the changes on Meliniki's <url> instead?","30":"user: Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?","31":"user: ED... They have drugs to fix that now, don't they?","32":"user: Eh? No, those facts were correct, why do you think they were not?","33":"user: What do you mean by \"one edit war away\"? And whats a siteban?","34":"user: Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn't the article's title \"Austria<span style=\"color:red\">u2013<\/span>Hungary\" (where, incidentally, it was moved after an \"Austria<span style=\"color:red\">-<\/span>Hungary\" period)? It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?","35":"user: Well, now you've got me puzzled. If you think he's a sneaky vandal, why did you revert my reversion of his numerical change?","36":"user: Why can't you just remove the offending phase and repost your comment?  This resolves the situation, does it not?","37":"user: Alright, the NPOV template is even worse, since it specifically points people to a talk page discussion which does not exist. Why are you adding these templates?","38":"user: On the third reading... Why not include an edit summary that tells me this? Why not revert my revert?","39":"user: Your obfuscation of the real issue is disengenuous; I'm rapidly losing respect for you. Is it not Wikipedia's mission to scornfully snub vandalism, which is done instantly, agressively, mercilessly?","40":"user: What part of \"use common sense\" did not get through to you? Was it the \"use,\" the \"common,\" the \"sense,\" or some combination thereafter?","41":"user: Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change?  And do you really think the RfC expressed consensus support for such a position?","42":"user: No kidding.  Perhaps you could be troubled to point out the parts you consider to be actionable as 'spam'?","43":"user: Such as the redundant link to ''Roe v. Wade''? Not an improvement?","44":"user: SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23?","45":"user: It's placed outside of the article body, not \"randomly put in the code\". Why such shuffling is a \"proper CHECKWIKKI task\" and why does it warrant saving an edit?","46":"user: You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton.  Why did you do it?","47":"user: The policy is quite clear; userids set up for the purposes of harassment or vandalism are blocked indefinitely.  That said, what policy is it that you think I'm not following?","48":"user: If someone is an immigrant and not legally documented, that someone is an illegal immigrant.  How can such a rally be anything but pro-illegal-immigration?","49":"user: This is what you wrote: \"In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times.\" What book, 1948??","50":"user: If you completely disagree then why havn't you required references on other airport pages??","51":"user: So how come he can have all types of slandereous links on his wiki page? Don't you think being an admin you should delete them?","52":"user: Why is your AWB robot changing '''&amp;Oslash;''' to the letter '''xd8'''? I asked you if all computers in the World are set up to read &Oslash; ?","53":"user: Yeeesh. Is it just me, or is it very difficult to follow these \"stream of consciousness\" postings?","54":"user: What City in Connecticut do you live in? And have you been to the north as your name suggests?","55":"user: Evidently, I don't have enough consciousness, because I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about. Could you tell me?","56":"user: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?","57":"user: Im interested in where you got the information you added stating woodlands house was closed in 2003. As far as i can see your wording was taken from one website, the milesfaster one. Should you not cite the website you quoted rather than look for a couple of others?","58":"user: Why would one want to re-create GNAA??","59":"user: Hi. With only a little over one day remaiming and <url> not editing and not contributing to the case as yet are there to be any known deviations from the standard procedure?","60":"user: Eight more articles semi-protected. How many of these damned T & J articles are there?","61":"user: I couldn't tell you why glam rock was there. Better?","62":"user: Ack, hit the wrong button?  How do you manage that?","63":"user: How can people edit them if it just redirects? Did you think about that?","64":"user: I'm wondering why in the <url> article, you keep changing the link <url> to <url> which just redirects to <url>?  Why not just leave the link to point to the intended article directy?","65":"user: Why isn't <url> included there? Is it possible there's a redirect in it's place?","66":"user: I saw you removed the copyright CSD from Universum University as being \"unclear copyright status\".  What am I missing?","67":"user: See <url>. I assume you didn't mean <url> ?","68":"user: Um... the Kent roast? Tentrake host?","69":"user: Personal attacks and refusing to answer questions. What are you hiding?","70":"user: Hi, sorry I think I'm missing something here. Why are you adding a red link to the vandalism page?","71":"user: I don't understand why did you add that message at the bottom of this page??","72":"user: Third: it's August 31 2010. Please check my userpage for reasons why I really don't feel useful today. Ask another admin, okay?","73":"user: I really would rather use, in English, the one expression \"<url>\" instead of \"<url>,\" \"marz,\" \"<url>,\" \"khaet,\" \"<url>,\" \"eparchia,\" \"ostan,\" \"khoueng,\" \"faritany,\" \"aimag,\" \"tinh\"u2014or \"<url>\" (aka \"<url>\").  <url> then why should \"<url>\" not be also?","74":"user: I'm not sure how I feel about you adding coordinates to locations all over the place, but rather than get into that, let's start with something easy: \"<url>\" does not equal \"<url>\". Do you need me to explain why, or was that just a typo?","75":"user: Right, so the links on your userpage? And what is the \"article\" you want me to check over?","76":"user: Well it looked as though it had stopped, certainly tapered off for a few days but now some bloody wanker has started adding it again. I don't suppose you know how to get a page protected, I've never had to do it before?","77":"user: Fair enough on the general murder victims. But Kriss Donald was British, was he not?","78":"user: Why do you ask me questions to which you already know the answers? Is it a rhetorical device?","79":"user: In case you didn't realize, one of the first things they states on that article was that if the information on a main or major character becomes long, then it warrants its own article. So, if that the case, then why did you merge <url>, since his article is long and he is the main character on <url>?","80":"user: So, let me make sure I understand this. You think that, if we remove an image as it does not meet the NFCC, you would then be able to upload the same image, only this time, it would meet the NFCC?","81":"user: Ah well, if you are going to have such a bizarre flight of fancy as far as to calling it an attack page then perhaps I will remove it. Maybe you should also look at how you interact with others?","82":"user: Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references.  Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada?","83":"user: ''Don't'' talk ''about'' me, in my virtual presence, and tell someone else to ignore me. Do you understand why this behavior is inappropriate?","84":"user: Drat forgot to sign.  You blanked my talk page and asked if I don't like K's?","85":"user: Having said that, I don't want to drive anyone away just because they can't write well. The question is, where do you begin?","86":"user: Just FYI, I have decided to be <url> and remove the screenshot at the top of the article.  There is already a link to a mirror of goatse.cx in external links, so why force readers to look at that?","87":"user: Your early edit's clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this?","88":"user: Links to attack sites and so are not allowed. You must know that you violated BLP?","89":"user: Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non-notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over-the-top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of \"credible notability\"?","90":"user: Because Wikipedia is an encylopaedia not a free advertising and self promotion venue. Why do you keep abusing it?","91":"user: Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?","92":"user: Please explain why you continue to <url> <url> <url> over the folk magic\/Christian revivalist wording in the lede despite the clear consensus against you.  You have not gained any favorable comments for your position in the RFC (which in fact is about the treasure seeking sentence you want to add and not about rewording or removing the existing sentence), so on what basis do you claim preeminence for your preferred wording, or for removing the sentences completely?","93":"user: The flag \"visible=yes\" means a comment on the page is made visible, not that the page is visible in search engines. Why did you remove flag?","94":"user: Just move <url> to <url>. And shouldn't the clean-up parameter be added to <url> also to make it work?","95":"user: Umm... isn't the template page itself semi-protected? If so, then shouldn't it be in the category?","96":"user: Wait a minute! I've done plenty of good edits, where did they all go?","97":"user: Sorry Less? What is that last postdirected at?","98":"user: How many times do I have to revert you before you stop? Do you want to get blocked?","99":"user: Based on what? Don't you think a little discussion is in order before doing this?","100":"user: I advance (Ultra-Orthodox) Rabbi Dr Mordechai Halperin, (Ultra-Orthodox), Rabbi Gershon Winkler, (Conservative) Rabbi Elliot Dorff, to you, for example, that the Torah and Talmud only forbids anal sex. Now explain exactly what division of Judaism is left, for you to claim your view fairly represents?","101":"user: You reverted my removal of the \"to critical acclaim\" description from this article. I cannot see where in <url> there is a basis for that claim -  it looks like a neutral factual review to me?","102":"user: Maybe others haven't noticed - or are too busy.  If you are thinking what I'm thinking, why am I reverting so many of your edits?","103":"user: When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it?","104":"user: I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn't you ask me this before?","105":"user: One more thing, you have a fellow Budgie insisting a losing appearance in an FA Cup semi is an \"Honour\" for your club.  I guess it's because you haven't won much lately, but really, a losing semi-finalist isn't an honour in the real sense of the word, is it?","106":"user: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?","107":"user: I don't see any of that in his deletion log.  Would you please find out which one it was as evidence so you're not blindly accusing an admin of deleting something they didn't delete?","108":"user: I know, I looked it up and fixed the article, but it was annoying that you just changed one small thing making the page contradict itself. What's the use changing it if the reader will have no idea what's going on?","109":"user: So your argument is that as long as you follow the \"rules,\" nothing else should matter? That if it's legal it's OK?","110":"user: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to \"encourage\" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the \"mocking\" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?","111":"user: OK done. When do I get my money?","112":"user: The article is not about this, at all. Could you explain your logic?","113":"user: In this <url> there was a loss of some info.  Was that intentional?","114":"user: Your new images of Micheal Knight and Devon look kinda squashed. Can you fix them or find better ones to replace them?","115":"user: I'm curious as to why you chose to <url> a full two minutes after my last comment?  Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue?","116":"user: I believe supserstition exists.  Why did you ask me?","117":"user: Comply with what your talk page says, get off and study!!!! Have you willpower?","118":"user: I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it's purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?","119":"user: Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I'll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit?","120":"user: (S)he seems to have violated the spirit of 3RR <url>. How do we deal with this guy?","121":"user: I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?","122":"user: Self-follow-up: Also, while sometimes the status quo should be maintained, by supporting it in this case, you're also supporting a \"revert-first, ask questions later\" approach to dealing with good faith edits. Is that really what you want?","123":"user: What page is this? Why was it deleted?","124":"user: Just to let you know, there's a <url> now. I don't know, is this mimicry allowed on Wikipedia?","125":"user: Where did you learn English? How come you're taking on a third language?","126":"user: PS - surprised you didn't make the annoucement in your blog.  Trying to fool your hordes of devoted readers?","127":"user: Wow, you waited a whole ten minutes. What's the problem?","128":"user: Why on earth have you deleted the article on the <url>?  Can you please undelete it?","129":"user: Since your last warning to BigBang19, he's continued to vandalize the ''Punk'd'' article, undoing the grammatical corrections I made some time ago, and inserting irrelevant, non-noteworthy material about Kuthcer's observence of Jewish holidays and his marriage to Demi Moore.  Can someone block this person for a period of more than just 24 hours so that he gets the message?","130":"user: I asked it before but I'm asking it again: Was it a Basque state? Can we say that?","131":"user: Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation?","132":"user: Actually, I counted 2 sets of <url>.  Can he be blocked for 48 hours?","133":"user: Oh and you seem to have deleted half of the stuff on <url> ... I presume this was a mistake?","134":"user: And if you use Coulson you would probably have to say \"According to Coulson...\". Have you read <url> yet?","135":"user: Since I have not been able to get an answer to this on the project page, let me ask you directly: Did you receive Durova's \"secret evidence\" prior to the blocking of <url>?","136":"user: BTW, I'm amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term?","137":"user: You see how time consuming and annoying it is when a person keeps on telling you to provide a source. Why do you want ''Michael'' to be just another compilation album?","138":"user: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?","139":"user: I will say this, though, in the form of a suggestion: it makes me a bit uneasy to see you so involved and sometimes argumentative in your nomination. Why not step back and let the community do its thing?","140":"user: What for did you analyse the two ArbCom cases Piotrus-Ghirla and Eastern European dispute? Was that suggested to you by Sciurinxe6 during your off-wiki discussions for 20 days?","141":"user: Reading your help desk comment, I'm totally confused now. Was it 2005 or 2006?","142":"user: Now I'm confused--did I miss something? Who was talking about G1, and who was talking about IP blocks?","143":"user: Isn't this section \"Vatican Responses\"? How come the wordings are not fact-based but seem to have devolved into media perceptions of the Vatican responses?","144":"user: No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this?","145":"user: Could you please clarify who the new users were exactly that you considered to be part of your 'sock farm'?  Or did you not even bother to research before making such claims?","146":"user: You said other sources supported the info in the infobox yet you did not indicate what sources. And why can't we use a primary source for his birth date?","147":"user: Hi. The original link (http:\/\/www.lgso.org.uk\/index.htm) gives a 404 error, but the amended URL (http:\/\/www.lgso.org.uk\/) works for me, so why do you say it's still dead?","148":"user: Let me know what you'd like me to do. Are you\/anyone thinking of copying over the temporary copy wholesale or in parts; destroying the edit history of either, both or neither..?","149":"user: Yesterday you undid an edit of mine (on the <url> article). What did you mean by \"a COI link\"?","150":"user: Well, look again! Does ''<url>'' look like a dictionary-definition page to you?","151":"user: Hey, can you block this moron from editing the IIHF Page? Or what can i do in such cases?","152":"user: I replied to you <url> but you didn't answer. Did you not see it?","153":"user: I certainly think more things should be deleted from enwiki, but TheCommunity(tm) is fickle. Are you complaining about something ''I'' did?","154":"user: SudoGhost, just a question. Do you think that simply calling someone's edits disruptive is very specific?","155":"user: And I guess with exception of 7 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, everybody else would end up in \"homophobia\" category. Or what would be the threshold?","156":"user: Wassat? LeaveVissToYou?","157":"user: I thought that, when some informations are mentioned about in ''desperate housewives'', it is a reliable source? So, in your way of thinking, Susan Mayer maiden name is not Bremmer or something like that?","158":"user: You also seem somedeal similar to <url>. Not logging in is not sockpuppetry but do you acknowledge that User:64.194.44.220 is you?","159":"user: OK, I'll bite. How is ''Matt \"Dirty\" Sanchez'' to be construed as anything other than a personal attack?","160":"user: Depends; do you care deeply about image policy? Or are you an incurable masochist?","161":"user: Thanks, but I believe I've covered the sustance. Could you also get Beeblebrox to strike the \"Mr\" insult, unless he was doing it deliberately?","162":"user: What's your issue with noting the copyright registration date for this piece?  Also, could you point me to the consensus you mentioned?","163":"user: This is irritating. What browser are you using?","164":"user: How can you possibly know that? Have you tried to find additional content and failed to find it?","165":"user: Are you saying you have never edited as anything else? What brought you to that particular article?","166":"user: On an unrelated note, the bot is listing arbitrary breaks in AfDs as separate open AfDs.  Any way to prevent that from happening?","167":"user: I don't know of any such tools. Have you tried posting your concerns to <url>?","168":"user: Well I came to the same conclusion as Rpyle731. Perhaps a trip to the talk page is in order?","169":"user: Who deleted it? Would I be violating due process if I undeleted it?","170":"user: But that doesn't follow <url>.  Perhaps you can discuss the idea there?","171":"user: The Olbermann thing is being discussed on the <url> talk page.  Do you have anything to add?","172":"user: The Radical Afrocentric Historiography article is now redirecting to Afrocentrism, on the basis it seems that its a subsection of Afrocentrism. Where else would like me to put it?","173":"user: Perhaps an essay could clarify this? \"Be Assertive, not Aggressive\", or \"Act like a Professional\"?","174":"user: Thanks for your reply. You are, I take it, aware that you can be blocked for disruptive editing?","175":"user: Also, what's the point on being adopted by another user? It sounds good and I'd like to be adopted, though I'd don't exactly know what I or the adopter would get out of it?","176":"user: Hi again!  Per your <url>, I'll leave questions here, which actually leads me to a question, hehe;  why would you want users to bring RfA discussion to your talk page rather than keeping it in a centralised viewable location on the RfA page where users are encouraged to submit questions for optional response by the candidate?","177":"user: Hi, I see from your post at the reference desk, which I saw from your post at <url>, about times for locating wreckage (by the way, I posted a list of biggies I could find record of that have never been found) that you have read the above article. I have recently started converting some stuff ther that was still in present tense to past tense, in preparation for a push towards the article becomming our first air disaster FA (not counting ''<url>'', of course) and was wondering: as someone who knew nothing about the crash before, and has just read the article, do you think it's possible?","178":"user: You're obviously an experienced editor.  Am I correct that this is not your first (or only) user name?","179":"user: Looking at Kotorkid's contributions on <url>, three hours seems too short for a block.  Considering that their three and only edits were all vandalism, would you support an indef-block for vandalism-only account for them?","180":"user: I suppose that there is nothing to be done about it, but Jamesd1 just buried a direct question to him, about compromise, under a long discussion about Alice Bailey's supposed religious views  (Bailey was not a Christian) that belong on a Bailey discussion forum, not on this article's talk page. Does not Wikipedia have some way to resolve editing situations in which editors refuse to compromise and end the arguing?","181":"user: I would like to create a few plots. Where can I access the geologic temperature record raw data?","182":"user: <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage?","183":"user: I used <url> as precedence. Thoughts?","184":"user: I have done every thing you have asked and I have attempted to gain a better understanding of how to do this in the future. Please tell me exactly what I can do to prove my ownership?","185":"user: That sounds like they are just \"general use\" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages?","186":"user: Despite our long-standing disagreement, I have no argument with you <url>. However, can I suggest you use a less opaque edit summary than  ''added info'' when doing something that is nonetheless controversial?","187":"user: My request to move the Jotated A (Cyrillic) article to A iotified has generated a bit of <url>.  I wondered if you wanted to express an opinion?","188":"user: Ok, why was it wrong??","189":"user: One last thing, I noticed that Astro's gender is given as male. Is this erroneously placed?","190":"user: While you are absolutely free to vote however you choose, FAC requires you lodge actionable objections and your objection as it stands right now is quite vague. Could you please specify it so I can take action and possibly reverse your vote?","191":"user: Lol, yes, simply! I would have no objection to something like this \"According to \".... Records\" the song was sent to mainstream radio as the official third single in may.\" OR something?","192":"user: I guess I must have misunderstood, sorry for that. Exactly what do you mean by having my promise to not use the tools for a year enforced by a bureaucrat?","193":"user: My contribution tried to show the impression to others I'am only trying to improve spelling. What's the difference between personel and persona?","194":"user: You say; ''I don't preview TfD before I close it each day.''  How do you then determine consensus?","195":"user: I have also used WP:RM for Norway attacks. Which one would be faster?","196":"user: It's archived onto CD; I'll have to search it out. Suggestion on what you'd like to see in the way of resolution?","197":"user: I tried searching for that link in the section that I was editing and it wasn't there I didn't edit from the top but just from the section. Does the filter only look inside the section or is it based on the whole talk page?","198":"user: Can we ask people to comment at the FAC? Like i did when i nominated her discography?","199":"user: Thanks for starting my page for me, that was very sweet of you. ^_^ But is editing my user page the same thing as editing a gaming article?","200":"user: I spotted a comment you made at the Help Desk discussion page: \"I'm in the process of sweeping Wikipedia of links to all its question answering departments, and replacing them with a single link in each location to route all questions traffic through an upgraded Wikipedia:Questions page.\" Do you mind me asking how you \"sweep\" Wikipedia of all those links? How do you find them all?","201":"user: Unfortunately, on the topic you have chosen, the excellence of what you are doing is far from the only issue. Are you producing an excellent article of a kind that should not actually be in Wikipedia but in some other more specialized project?","202":"user: When you say \"thrown off\" articles which tend to be in math, the sciences, IT, etc., do you mean making them inaccurate? Or do you mean they were helpful in creating them?","203":"user: I read the article and can see where it already addresses some of his reliabilty issues. I guess that as long as it was clear that the quotes were from his autobiography and if any other info on the lack of collaboration (from the intro or foreword of the new edition of his autobiography) were included, I think it would be OK. Is there a lot of material to add that is only in his autobiography?","204":"user: Your block of the <url> article came immediately after three edits that blanked sourced content without any explanation. These edits were unrelated to the edit war that got the article blocked, so could you please to restore the content?","205":"user: I'm serious, I just don't want a mistake to happen to another person that happened to my friend.  By the way, does he violate <url>?","206":"user: If it works consistently, a printonly abbreviation would make sense. But how many editors would actually see that form to catch problems should they arise?","207":"user: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was \"Left-libertarianism in political philosophy\".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?","208":"user: Hi, we worked on a few Australian-related articles together. May be you want to make a look on my <url>?","209":"user: Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?","210":"user: Regarding <person>, you've made this a Beta - In Use template since January. Is there any hope of making it live at some point in the near future?","211":"user: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l9lk0B1p3k0 Yamaguchi Japan -Candidate Site for the <url>. Time for an article?","212":"user: I have it now; it lists 22 Members, seven officers and a large number of sons of Members. Do you think we could run to a new article, say <url>?","213":"user: So I take it you live in Perth? Have you ever been to Virginia?","214":"user: I see you don't edit the heats from morning session. Will you be here for the finals ?","215":"user: While I looked there, it had a nice little message at the top saying \"To report persistent vandalism or spamming, see WP:AIV\" And this definitely looked like persistent vandalism. Should that comment on <url> be updated then?","216":"user: Given what I see there, Finlay, I would argue that Marnanel's work is derivative, and that nohat's only request for derivative works is that they be released under the GFDL, which it's my understanding that Marnanel's work is.  Is there a section I'm misreading?","217":"user: Hi, I saw you protected <url> (<url>, <url>, <url>). In light of their signing to <url>, their <url>, <url>, and <url> <url> <url>, would you mind unprotecting it so I can give it a better treatment?","218":"user: What do you think?  Worthwhile or not?","219":"user: I thought that VAMOS section was dealing primarily with captions (perhaps a clearer wording is needed there?). Also, I have seen dates used as adjectives quite often - the \"1848 Revolution\", for example - where did you read about this rule?","220":"user: Ok, I'd agree about <url> being better. Should I delete the other one (you could also tag it for speedy deletion as a mistake)?","221":"user: I'll have a look (probably just for copyediting duties) once Zag has finished the larger changes. Keep me posted?","222":"user: Soo... I should merge and rewrite, right?","223":"user: You were asking for a source for the <url> mention of the <url> service to Lagos from March 29th, which you reverted.  Would <url> do?","224":"user: Hey, did you ever read over the material I laid out for you - content as well as ideas for organization of an article?  Any feedback?","225":"user: But someone actually remade the article here, http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOSGuy\/Joe_Siegler it's a subset of someone's user profile, but they are essentially circumventing a deleted article. Is this against wikipedia policy?","226":"user: that's all it said on the description of the object, I myself do not know as well what the museum means with \"old\". Maybe it came from the theater from a previous renovation?","227":"user: I create <url>, and then I would click \"Move\" on the top of the page I want to merge (for example <url>? Is that how you do it?","228":"user: Rklawton, I apologize for persisting, but criterion 8 of <url> says that a band must be the \"most prominent of the LOCAL scene of a city\" to be notable enough to justify a page, and Finish Ticket is demonstrably the most prominent band of the local San Francisco scene. Why is that not sufficient?","229":"user: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?","230":"user: |} Thanks for the contribution. Halloween DYK?","231":"user: I created these articles. So what your saying is that when I finish the bigger article, redirect these articles to the big one?","232":"user: I just reverted your edits to the <url> page, because you seemed to make a number of major changes without providing an explanation for them, except the word 'Infobox' in your edit summary. Can you provide any references for the changes?","233":"user: Oh dear. Does that mean it's too difficult a read for Wiki?","234":"user: I seem to be doing something wrong moving pages to wiktionary, because when I complete a move to <url>, it just stays there as though there were nothing \"special\" about that move target. What am I doing wrong?","235":"user: I might have just done a wrong revert on this art - what do you think?  Small cf Singapores  Changi maybe - but, ...?","236":"user: Mmm its a little difficult to see on the new one. How about the one on the right?","237":"user: <url>. I wonder if anyone will actually suspect a conflict of interest?","238":"user: <url> is a bit of a stretch. Do you think you might strike it?","239":"user: I guess the best thing to do for now, is to not do anything and see what happens.  Don't you agree?","240":"user: Thank you! Was I the only one who found Lima's tone to be, to say the least, unpleasant?","241":"user: Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis?  Was the proof not within the citation, or was the citation not considered primary?","242":"user: After <url> <url>, all\/most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re-nominating <url> for FA or GA status?","243":"user: I've been meaning to add soundclips to the Suede and Stone Roses articles (3u20134 for each). I can get to it over the weekend; suggestions?","244":"user: Hope you get the concerns worked out. Question: Why is the bot using <nowiki><sup>2<\/sup><\/nowiki> instead of xb2 ?","245":"user: It's interesting that the \"alternative medicine\" bit was inserted without discussion on 4 Dec. 2010, by my old friend <url>.  What's that about?","246":"user: '''Question''' to both of you.  Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input?","247":"user: You've not said anything recently; Are you still editing? Is everything OK?","248":"user: OK, lets get a screenshot then. What is your keyboard layout, is it a qwerty keyboard?","249":"user: Tips? Something about not feeding?","250":"user: Unreliable websites should be avoided altogether as even their citations might be wrong. Do you see a specific problem with the AKC breed standard?","251":"user: Right now on the list of living supercentenarians page, #23 and #25 are both listed as Zhai Xiuying. Which one is which?","252":"user: ... is discouraged, but should redirects be created for situations like <url>? Inclusively, I believe you once told me that something like <url> should be changed per the guideline?","253":"user: I'm somewhat puzzled by your recent edits on the Harper page, which have left two different sets of footnotes.  Could you please explain your rationale for the change?","254":"user: What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?","255":"user: I think you're referring to <url>? For example, <url>?","256":"user: While the cat's away, the mice will play. Am I to assume your tongue is planted firmly in cheek in not writing \"domus mea est domus tua\"?","257":"user: Hi, I was wondering why it is that <url> only has two articles in it -- and whether it should be kept. Has it ever been more fully populated?","258":"user: He Colfer, just to let you know I changed the headings in name (I think we should avoid making diaries, but order based on activities), but kept (hopefully) the spirit of your changes in tact. How does it look to you?","259":"user: If you are referring to the page blanking, that has been rectified.  What other concerns do have about the content?","260":"user: How r u doing? what are u upto these days?...what are your current contribs?","261":"user: But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book?","262":"user: I noticed you reverted a US English speller.  Shouldn't the section <url> actually be spelled ''Tyres'' for internal consistency?","263":"user: You said in Terrorism:Talk that a user can be blocked from a particular article.  How could you block all the sockpuppets of that user ?","264":"user: I don't understand this <url>. Maybe you can explain what problems you have with the u9806u98a8u76f8u9001 reference?","265":"user: I know <url> is one, what about <url>? Shouldn't it also be a primary topic or are there actual rules which discourage practice of \"all caps\"?","266":"user: I removed the hyphen from \"oldest-known\", which is hard to see if you aren't looking for it. Does that answer the question?","267":"user: I would never do that without consulting the blocking admin first (and probably I wouldn't either way). What do you say?","268":"user: I.m keen to see your recent abbey article on the main page, but there are no references. Can this be fixed?","269":"user: Problem isn't too hard; I'm taking care of it.  Had you discovered <person>?","270":"user: No I don't mean for that article, I mean in general. Because when I pass nominations, the code on the GAN page doesn't work for me, do you have to ill some of the code in?","271":"user: We both seemed to have overlooked R7 and R7.1, they both appear to be equally passing, but I personally feel 7.1 is the preferred one. Thoughts?","272":"user: Your bot's edits aren't being marked as such; that is, they still appear in my watchlist when I choose to hide bot edits. Could you do something about this?","273":"user: I notice that you're adding <person> to places of histrical significance, but in some cases they are not listed on the <url>.  Are you trying to follow the list, or expanding it to places that perhaps should be on the list?","274":"user: Hi Elen. Are you aware that you are currently listed at <url> as inactive?","275":"user: <url>. What do you think should be done?","276":"user: Hello, I'm a sysop in <url>, I'm creating an Upload page like English Wikipedia <url>, I've changed file MediaWiki:Licenses\/vi-ownwork corresponding to Own work options, but they still display Media:Licenses information.

Or do you mean that the envelope, as a result of its pores, allows ion passage?","279":"user: I couldn't help but notice on your userpage templates for Clive Barker, Child's Play and so on to place on pages related to those subjects. I've never known how to create them, so could you help?","280":"user: Thank you for semiprotecting that page.  Why is it that everyone seems to vandalize one page at the same time?","281":"user: Well, I do have one question. If I were to come across a page that I would normally mark as a CSD- like copyright infringement, etc, as an admin can I just delete it or do I need to mark it CSD and ask another opinion?","282":"user: Many people have mentioned this mythical facillity - I've never found it, and assumed it was only available to sysops, which I am not. Is this the case?","283":"user: i took the photo, and if the kludgy licensing template would allow me to license i would. do you actually fix things or tag spam?","284":"user: That Brian Boru guy moved <url> to a longer name. Invisible Kid becomes a disambiguation in this instance?","285":"user: Hey, i saw you added <person> some time ago to the pic page. I'm just curious, why do you want it to still be available here?","286":"user: Did you see the final messages on that now banned user 100% Christians page? They really show he is 100 percent Christian dont they?","287":"user: I probably would have gotten to Sinnott and Simon eventually, but I started to feel like I was abusing the peer review process. :) Did you see my note in a section above about another user who likes to work on comics creator articles?","288":"user: Per the TFD debate, would you think it a reasonable solution to redirect this e.g. to <person>?","289":"user: I see <url> some <person> tags to the <url> page. Is there something in particular you feel needs citation, or did the article just look generally reference-sparse?","290":"user: There are many articles without an infobox image because nobody has found a free alternative. Wasn't there one of Singer at Comic-Con ages ago?","291":"user: Hi, I made on comment on the image page about this being different than Sbarro3 image.  Please... comment?","292":"user: And while I'm on templates, I spotted <url>. Does it affect the ME templates?","293":"user: Hi Sukh - gotta request to make. Could you please have a look at this article and its FAC and give it a copyedit?","294":"user: Hi there, seems like your warning to <url> didn't work and the IP user has again removed sourced information on the <url> article.

Is there a WP: page describing this and how to do it?","300":"user: Well? What do you think?","301":"user: I went to WP:VAND and looked up sneaky vandalism. To qualify for the reward, does it only have to qualify as sneaky or does it have to be \"extra\" sneaky?","302":"user: It would seem to me that this category provides no overall benefit to wiki and only serves as another list of organizations which seem to be targeted by the generally negative tone of LGAT articles. Would it make more sense, or be more proper, to include the relevant categories on the individual articles themselves, rather than have an LGAT category?","303":"user: Just asking one quick question since it'll probably be asked at RfA. Do you know the difference between a block and a ban?","304":"user: The Daily Mail has republished pages from the manifesto in full, (<url>) including that of his personal data. Is this the ethical jump you need to use the info on Wikipedia?","305":"user: Iu2019ve noticed youu2019ve been removing links in see also sections that have links elsewhere in the article.

Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?","307":"user: I see you originally created this article, so maybe you can sort out what looks like some confusion. The article says that it was created by Diotisalvi, and that the church was known from at least 1113, but the <url> article says that he worked in the second half of the 12th century, and created the <url>, which started in 1152. Did he design both?","308":"user: If you can't back up that I've used it in WP with a diff\/evidence, do you feel that it's appropriate to say that I've used the term in the context such as the diff I provided above?  If so, why?","309":"user: I'm sorry, but that does not respond to my question at all. Should I take it to indicate a no?","310":"user: I was told by a wikipedian that these following three sources are unreliable <url>. Is that true?","311":"user: Hey, I saw your continued edits to <url> and hoped you were a resident - since I was hoping to get a photograph of the Capitol Theatre in the city.

Did you?","318":"user: I note the copyvio tag you placed on <url>. How do readers compare the content at the source you specified with the content of the article text you removed?","319":"user: Josiah, believe me, I understand how you feel, and unless you really feel like it, I don't think you should involve yourself in the dispute, because it seems intractable. My question is more a procedural one: if an RfC doesn't generate consensus, and an edit war continues, what's the next step?","320":"user: I tried <url> and it worked for me. What articles did you try using it on?","321":"user: There have been no comments for over two weeks at <url>.  Do you think it might be time to make one more post on the math and physics talk pages and then edit the header to say consensus has been reached?","322":"user: This is a toughy. Do you think it could be integrated with <url>?","323":"user: Rxe9nyi leaves out the other gruesome details and adds the context of the fortress.  Do you know which details are in the most widespread and\/or original version of this tale?","324":"user: Please see <url>. Should I move the material to the <url> and resubmit the nomination?","325":"user: Just had a look at <url>, and oh dear god. Any interest?","326":"user: So both of us already broke 3RR.  Do you want to esclate it?","327":"user: I haven't been lately as I've been pretty busy in real life. Is there something you'd like me to check out?","328":"user: Hi Taivo, I'm beginning to have my suspicions that Fellowscientist might be you-know-who from past debates. Am I being paranoid?","329":"user: Do your hardback copies of <url> have a dust jacket (mine doesn't).  If so, does it look like the cover of the 1971 paperback pictured in the article?","330":"user: Huaiwei,  there is this guy HkCaGu who insist that we shouldnt put Tianjin as one of Xiamen Airline's destination from Singapore just because it passes by Xiamen(MF's HUB) however, this is a direct flight from singapore to tianjin via xiamen. what are your views?","331":"user: I don't know, the only thing I can think of is that I changed his name to \"Psycho Derek\" for Wikipedia:CommonName purposes.

Any suggestions?","345":"user: Would you be willing to do another pre-FAC review of a different article for me?  Specifically, the \"John J. Tigert\" article?","346":"user: Thanks for the redactions :).

How often does this happen?","356":"user: Interesting. May I venture to enquire why?","357":"user: Hi again - it looks like the same user is editing out all the information about Destiny being self-centred again.

What SVG editor did you use?","363":"user: I'm working on improving the references on Kulwicki's article to get more reliable ones. I've also worked on improving <url>'s article toward GA. Do you know much about drag racing?","364":"user: After looking through a bunch of those, I think the lead should be formatted like this: a paragraph explaining who he is, a paragraph summarizing his life and career, and a paragraph summarizing why he is so great. What do you think?","365":"user: Hi Skully, I've been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks, and I think you should be a admin.

Can you add a source to those tables?","372":"user: BTW, I translated the page to the best of my ability (my Spanish only carried me so far). Do you speak Portuguese?","373":"user: Hello, it was requested that some of the details be removed so as to make the article a bit more general. Is that ok?","374":"user: There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some. I was wondering if there is any kind of invisible comment that can be added to the article in these situations so that the report doesn't include it, or if you have any other thoughts about how it might be possible to handle this situation?","375":"user: I have found a better citation for reference 7, but am not sure how to insert the page number (p. 97 from the book cited).  Do you know the right format for this?","376":"user: You beat me to the punch with the archaeological discovery.<url>. I'm curious, do you know if any Scottish newspapers reported it?","377":"user: Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month: I've noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old, long-deleted monthly categories in the <person> queue, because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again. I'm just putting this forward as an idea for discussion, and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone, I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and\/or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category, it would retag the article to the ''current'' month instead of recreating the old one?","378":"user: I seem to have adopted this article, since country music and dance are interests of mine. Can you recommend an easy to use bot that would help me in keeping those unwanted links out of the article?","379":"user: Thank you for the links and the explanation. I'd like to help with the project, what did you have in mind?","380":"user: Hi, <url> moved <url> to <url>, and then a bot came in to correct a double redirect so that the page can't simply be moved back again. Can you use your administrative powers to make it so?","381":"user: Sorry for the late reply, but I usually check new additions from the bottom of the page, not the top.

How could I contact you?","383":"user: Hi. Is there any chance of getting <url> unblocked from making edits on Wikipedia?","384":"user: OK, I've started the deletion debate at <url>.

Did you know its one week to Halloween, will you be there?","397":"user: Thanks for blocking this user -- he promptly erased the warnings on his talk page (I put them back).  I guess a block doesn't automatically block the talk page, huh?","398":"user: Hi, I see you were involved in creating the ship infobox.

Just let you know?","400":"user: I think the article needs work. For example, I think \"U.S. late 1980s - 1990s\" should after \"Detroit sound.\" \"UK 1990s\" should after \"U.S. late 1980s - 1990s.\" What do you think?","401":"user: When I wrote <url> I was not quite sure if it was a synonym of <url>, and hence did not perform a merge. Could you clarify if they are indeed the same, and if so whether we should merge the articles?","402":"user: I need to read more about what exactly a pastoral opera is supposed to be. Perhaps it should be a supercategory?","403":"user: My graphics editing skills aren't up to the creation of a map such as this from scratch, but I could probably do an adequate job of removing the red and orange lines and the related entries in the map legend. Would it be useful for me to take a whack at that?","404":"user: Hi, thanks for letting me know about my signature not being linked. I tried to save the settings in preferences - did it work?","405":"user: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?","406":"user: Yes please! Buffing up ''<url>'' to at least reflect a bit better on current state-of-play-taxonomically would be good :) Any Reliable Sources call it a <url> ?","407":"user: Hi, I think that you do a fantastic job on DELSORT. However, I was just wondering if, when you add to Schools, whether you would be good enough to add them to the appropriate section, please?","408":"user: I wish I could find a better one but I don't think I know where one is I think the composition needs more information. Can you do that?","409":"user: Hey Alex... I just emailed a United Kingdom professor, intending to email a University of Kentucky professor.

Since you are experienced in ''botovodstvo'', could you help us with the issue <url>?","420":"user: I really like the template you used at <url> but it dosen't seem to exist on the  WP:Vandalism page. Where can I grab it?","421":"user: My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject?","422":"user: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?","423":"user: On a related note, I went through your recent article-work, and saw nothing wrong with your contributions. I was wondering, would you like me to grant your account <url> to make it easier to revert vandalism when you come across it?","424":"user: Alternatively, maybe the second column could be '''Country of origin''' and Rosen could simply be denoted USA\/Poland, while Pillsbury would be USA\/USA, without his US State being mentioned - it would be less confusing I think. Any thoughts?","425":"user: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?","426":"user: Yes, it is a matter of civility.  Do you think a year would be better?","427":"user: Hi, I hadn't realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this.

Can you point me to a page that has such a feature?","429":"user: I had an editorial dispute with a user called <url><, but I'm not responding to him anymore as it seems to escalate into heated arguments.

It seems to need a table to be set up - do you have the schema or sql for that handy?","433":"user: I look forward to your genre plan. What do you have in mind?","434":"user: Presumably the CfD will be inconclusive.

Were you there too?","436":"user: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you.

I've gotten a few of these since then, but just wondering if you remembered and got any shots that would be worth using on here?","442":"user: Perhaps you can help me. How do I view the status of a vandalism report I've made?","443":"user: I understand, it could be quite time consuming. Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I'm finished with some work)?","444":"user: Hi, I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion. Can you have a look at <url>?","445":"user: It was nominated for speedy deletion because he wasn't notable.

Is there a mistake somewhere?","447":"user: I was doing some minor editing on this, and noticed that the date of death in the intro and infobox don't match.

Are those his scholarly works?","455":"user: <url> is at it again, adding in the \"in the Premiership\" content you & I successfully merged several weeks ago.

I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?","475":"user: One more thing if you want, let's talk on the Seinfeld talk page. I think I am taking up your talk page so let's talk there instead, ok?","476":"user: Thanks for your input. Would you mind voicing your opinion in the GMC's talk page?","477":"user: This is great so far! What do you feel you need help with?","478":"user: Thanks for the redirect help!  Is that something I can do myself in the future, or is that an admin thing?","479":"user: Interesting illustration on the PrIze law page of a Zeppelin taking a Norwegian vessel as a prize in 1917.  I wonder whether you could point me to a source for more information on this incident?","480":"user: Thanks for adding the WSL windmill picture. I see you are in Belgium, any chance of adding more pictures to the various lists?","481":"user: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?","482":"user: And after seeing this talk page, I'll also note that there is no difference between scalars in math, physics and computing, those articles should all be merged together. :-\/ Maybe you'd be interested in doing such a merge?","483":"user: Interrobang has asked me if I would also help mentor you when he is not around. I said that I would gladly help out if it was ok with you?","484":"user: I'm on it. Instead, could I persuade you to offer comments on the FAC page of <url>?","485":"user: Arguably, listing the former constructors and even the template itself is not necessary. Could we please try reinstating the previous version and see if and how many other folk don't find the decade information useful\/intriguing?","486":"user: Since working on the article you wrote, I have become fascinated with this band.  Is any of their music availabe online?","487":"user: Don't worry about it. Take it easy, keep the ranting to a minimum and the productive editing to a maximum :) And you're still not convinced you should get an account?","488":"user: Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account?","489":"user: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of \"notability\" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of \"notability\" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?","490":"user: Hi I noticed that you changed the category at <url> from \"People from Alabama\" to \"People from Elmore County, Alabama\". Is this appropriate, as Opothleyahola was dead for three years before Elmore county had been organized and had been forcibly removed from the area more than thirty years before?","491":"user: Regarding your time setting, I'm a little unsure what you want to do - there are only two things you can change - the timezone offset from GMT, which you set at the bottom of the screen by selecting the correct offset for your location from the list - I'm guessing Asia\/Calcutta would be about right, and the way the date\/time is displayed, which you choose from the list of five options at the top of the screen. What problems are you having ?","492":"user: I've been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons.com refs (per Quadzilla99's comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don't seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance?","493":"user: Hi again! Have you had a chance to get it lately?","494":"user: I restored the lead picture series I like. What do you think?","495":"user: Hi Darwi. Just to ask you as curiosity, how did that debate ended?","496":"user: Okay thanks I'll try it! DId you choose the pictures yourself?","497":"user: I apologize if I have misunderstood.
